      <h2>Looking for a new tool in competitive market of cloud service delivery?</h2>
      <p>     Bear paws are known for their killing power, but did you know they are also known for their <em>coding</em> power?
      </br>   <strong>Its happening.</strong>
      </br>   Through exordinary and wholly embaressing means, a wild bear was able to access a laptop device with a cellular ISP.
              Fortunately for us, the bear is using the laptop to design websites for small, mid, and global scale enterprises
              for roar-diculous rates. You can't beat these rates with tranquilizers or a compassionate team of zoologists!
              We can only assume the bear's computer is powered by solar, hydro, or what we have come to belive; human folly.
